# NBA-Visual
React JS based NBA Player Strength Visualization
- Created a dashboard using React, D3 and Ant Design backed by API from stats.nba.com to visualize individual playerâ€™s shot data,
  including a shot chart and user profile view.
  
- Created 4 extra filters and 2 shot themes to provide more customized visualization on the shot chart.

- Optimized the user experience by developing an autocomplete player search bar providing a list of players(image and name) in the 
  suggestion list.

These pictures show the webpage and its functions.
